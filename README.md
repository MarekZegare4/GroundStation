# Goal
Focus of this project is to develop all in one antenna tracking device capable of standalone operation for RC/Autonomous UAVs.

# What's working?
- Azimuth and inclination calculation - **Needs more testing**
- Stepper motor control
- Saving tracker's position to a file for later use
- TCP mavlink data stream via Raspberry Pi's access point

# To do

1. Integrate all necessary components into a PCB
2. Finish software development
	 - UI for built in LCD
  	 - Web dashboard and config
	 - On-board GPS module integration
3. Documentation
